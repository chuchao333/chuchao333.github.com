.. highlights::

    Computational processes are abstract beings that inhabit computers. As they
    evolve, processes manipulate other abstract things called data. The evolution
    of a process is directed by pattern of rules called a program.


Why use Lisp for the book?

.. highlights::
    The most significant unique feature of Lisp is the fact that Lisp descriptions
    of processes, called procedures, can themselves be represented and manipulated
    as Lisp data. The importance of this is that there are powerful program-design
    techniques that rely on the ability to blur the traditional distinction between
    "passive" data and "active" processes.

The three mechanisms of combining simple ideas to form more complex ideas in any
powerful programming languages:

1. primitive expressions
#. means of combination
#. means of abstraction
