    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The module provides an implementation of heap queue algorithm, also known as
priority queue algorithm.</p>

<h2>Highlights</h2>

<ul>
<li>Zero-based indexing is used, so the children's index of node with index k
are (2<em>k + 1) and (2</em>k + 2) respectively.</li>
<li>Internally a 'min heap' is maintained rather than 'max heap', which is more
generally used in algorithm textbooks.</li>
<li>Three general functions based on heaps are also provided:</li>
</ul>


<p>.. code-block:: python</p>

<pre><code># Merge multiple sorted inputs into a single sorted output
# (for example, merge timestamped entries from multiple log files)
heapq.merge(*iterables)

# The following two functions are effectively like
# sorted(iterable, key=key, reverse=True)[:n] and
# sorted(iterable, key=key)[:n],
# but they perform best with smaller values of n
heapq.nlargest(n, iterable[, key])
heapq.nsmallest(n, iterable[, key]))
</code></pre>

<h2>Pythonic stuff</h2>

<p>Rich comparison methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>.. code-block:: python</p>

<pre><code>def cmp_lt(x, y):
    # use __lt__ if available; otherwise, try __le__
    return x &lt; y if hasattr(x, '__lt__') else (not y &lt;= x)
</code></pre>

<p>In python, there are 6 so called "Rich Comparison" methods, x &lt; y calls
x.<strong>lt</strong>(y) and others are similar (<strong>le</strong> and &lt;=; <strong>gt</strong> and >=; <strong>eq</strong> and ==;
<strong>ne</strong> and &lt;>). Arguments to rich comparison  methods are never coerced. see
<code>coercion &lt;http://docs.python.org/glossary.html#term-coercion&gt;</code>_</p>

<h2>Code comments</h2>

<p>Why heapify(x) is O(n)?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is not obvious at first by seeing the code, given that there is a 'while'
loop in <em>siftup and also a while loop in </em>siftdown(called in _siftup). Let's
look into it further:</p>

<p>1) in the while loop of <em>siftup, it takes O(L) time for nodes that L levels
   above leaves.
2) and in the while loop of </em>siftdown called in <em>siftup, it takes at most L
   steps, so </em>siftdown is O(L).
3) since we have n/4 nodes in level 1, n/8 nodes in level 2, and finally one
   root node, which is lg(n) levels above leaf, so the total amount in the while
   loop of heapify is:</p>

<p>| <strong>n/4 * c + n/8 * c + n/16 * 3c + ... + 1 * lg(n) * c</strong>, and let n/4 = 2<sup>k,</sup>
  after simplification, we get:
| <strong>c * 2<sup>k(1/2<sup>0</sup></sup> + 2/2<sup>1</sup> + 3/2<sup>2</sup> + ... + (k+1)/2<sup>k)**,</sup> as the limit of
  </strong>(k+1)/2<sup>k**</sup> is 0 when k is infinite, so the term in the brackets bound to
  a constant, from this we can conclude that heapify is O(2<sup>k),</sup> which is O(n).
|</p>

<p>Why it continues to find the smaller child until a leaf is hit in _siftup?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As explained in the comment by the module author, this is a ad hoc to reduce
the comparisons on the following operations on the heap.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am going to start the series of posts on reading the source of python standard
modules. I will go with the pure python modules first, and maybe later I can
continue with C implementations of the modules. Let's see how far I could go.</p>

<h2>What will be included</h2>

<ul>
<li>A brief introduction of the module. (It should be very short, people can go to
the standard library doc for more information.)</li>
<li>Special highlights about the important APIs, implementation details.</li>
<li>Python features/idioms/tricks/gotchas that worth the whistle, especially those
I was not familiar with</li>
<li>Detail explanations about the tricky part of the code if any</li>
</ul>


<h2>What will not be included</h2>

<ul>
<li>The example usage of the various APIs, for this kind of stuff,
<code>Python module of the week &lt;http://www.doughellmann.com/PyMOTW/&gt;</code>_ is a better
place to go</li>
</ul>


<p>Also, alone the way, I may start another series on some specific 'advanced topics'
in python, like <strong>descriptor</strong>, <strong>decorator</strong>, <strong>method resolution order(mro)</strong>
and so on. Mainly about why they are introduced into python, how they are used and
the typical use cases. This is inspired by the blogs about
<code>python history &lt;http://python-history.blogspot.com/&gt;</code>_</p>

<p>This post will also be used to track my progress.</p>
